# MonteCarloMethodAnimalPopulation
AUTHOR: Briana Berger

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this program is to determine the average number of squirrels seen until a fox squirrel is seen.

VERSION or DATE: 12/21/2017

DIFFICULTIES: I had a hard time figuring out what the lesson wanted me to do. I wasn't sure if I had to print my values to the txt file or my text print outs.

LEARNING MOMENTS: Learning how to print out to a file and then retrieving that data again was fun and allowed me to go outside my comfort zone. With the lesson posted on the help site, I was finally able to understand the logic behind the program and what I needed to do. It really expanded my thought process on how to do the code.

WHAT I ENJOYED: It was fun trying out new things and debugging the program.
